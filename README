INSTALLATION

cd transmission-2.61/
./configure -with-gtk && make
cd ..


RECORDING A SESSION

./new_session.py 

This should launch the Transmission client. Open a torrent file and complete the download. You can then quit the client.


REPLAYING A SESSION

In a separate terminal, launch the SuperCollider engine:

sclang synth.sc 

Depending on your local settings, you may also need to start and configure Jack and route output from SuperCollider to where you want it.

Replay the session:

./play.py -s sessions/120715-101708/ --predecoded

Wait until SC has displayed that it has loaded all wav files. Then press Play (or space) in the GUI.
