Here are some notes about my lessons from trying to install transmission-2.61 on Ubuntu 11.10.

This version of transmission seems to require gtk 3.4.4.

First, I installed gtk and its dependencies in their default locations (/usr/local/lib). This worked fine, until I rebooted the machine and X Windows would no longer start. It seems that glib or some other library caused a conflict, as the problem was solved by removing these libraries manually from /usr/local/lib.

Instead I was able to install gtk 3.4.4 in my home directory. The following things helped when building dependencies (gtk-3 and glib-2) and transmission:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/alex/lib/pkgconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/alex/lib
./configure --prefix=/home/alex
